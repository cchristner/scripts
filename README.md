I use this to crawl my .docx files I use for writing and note taking for keywords or phrases.

Works well for now, but not too many files.

Will probably need to think about this if scale becomes too much to sift through.

To Do:
1. Make the files return in a way that makes them easily searched for, or even clickable. Maybe use the numbered list it returns, and then gives another prompt for the user to input one or multiple numbers and the script will auto open them?
